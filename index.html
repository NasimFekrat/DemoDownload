      <p>
        With a robust blend of technical acumen and diverse professional experience, I have carved a niche as a
        proficient Full Stack Web Developer. My journey in technology began with a Bachelor of Science in Computer
        Engineering from Azad University, Central Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran, culminating in a pivotal final project on
        the Scrutiny and Implementation of Wireless Communication in Smart House. This project not only laid the
        foundation for my technical prowess but also ignited a passion for creating innovative solutions.
        <br />
        Currently, I am leveraging my full spectrum of skills as a Full Stack Web Developer at Crosslinx Transit
        Solution in Toronto, ON. Since August 2023, I have been pivotal in developing a comprehensive web application
        for asset tracking, data storage, and reporting. My work, characterized by a blend of PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and
        CSS, and the innovative use of Power BI for data visualization, has significantly enhanced operational
        efficiencies and informed decision-making processes. My commitment to implementing security best practices and
        my proactive approach to maintaining the application highlight my dedication to excellence and continuous
        improvement.
        <br />
        My technical skills are comprehensive, encompassing coding, server and database management, version control, and
        deployment tools. I excel in responsive and mobile-first design, Bootstrap, React, Node.js, RESTful API design
        and development, and am proficient in cloud platforms like Cloudways. My expertise in MS Office, advanced Excel,
        and Power BI further enhances my ability to deliver
        insightful and impactful solutions.
        <br />
        Beyond my technical capabilities, I am a collaborator at heart, skilled in working within teams and utilizing
        platforms like Git and GitHub for version control and project management. My career trajectory is a testament to
        my adaptability, technical proficiency, and unwavering commitment to advancing the field of web development. I
        am not just a developer; I am a visionary, continually seeking to expand my knowledge and embrace emerging
        technologies to stay at the cutting edge of the industry.
